# mc-betteranvils

This is just a small script for resetting the prior work penalty on all items in a minecraft world.

Why? Because the prior work penalty a dumb mechanic.

WARNING: I haven't tested this pretty much at all, so backup your world before using it just in case.

## Usage
```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python betteranvils.py /path/to/my/world/
```

ps. use a virtual env. for everything. always.
